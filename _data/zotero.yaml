  abstract: >-
    What is the significance of monotheism in modern western culture, taking
    into account both its problematic and promising aspects? Biblical texts and
    the biblical faith traditions bear a continuous, polemical tension between
    exclusive and inclusive perceptions and interpretations of monotheism.
    Western monotheism proves itself to be multi-significant and heterogeneous,
    producing boundary-setting as well as boundary-crossing tendencies, is the
    common thesis of the authors of this book, who have been collectively
    debating this theme for two years in an interdisciplinary scholarly setting.
    Their contributions range from the fields of biblical and religious studies,
    history and philosophy of religion, systematic theology, to gender studies
    in theology and religion.The authors also explain the particular
    contribution of their own theological discipline to these debates.

  abstract: >-
    This is the first full-scale assessment of the theological, social and
    ideational implications of our new understandings of ancient Israel's social
    and religious development. Scholars now stress the gradual emergence of
    Israel out of the culture of ancient Palestine and the surrounding ancient
    Near East rather than contrast Israel with the ancient world. Our new
    paradigms stress the ongoing and unfinished nature of the monotheistic
    'revolution', which is indeed still in process today. Gnuse takes a further
    bold step in setting the emergence of monotheism in a wider intellectual
    context: he argues brilliantly that the interpretation of Israel's
    development as both an evolutionary and revolutionary process corresponds to
    categories of contemporary evolutionary thought in the biological and
    palaeontological sciences (Punctuated Equilibrium).

  abstract: >-
    Monotheism is a powerful religious concept shaped by competing ideas and the
    problems they raised. Surveying New Testament writings and Jewish sources
    from before and after the rise of Christianity, James F. McGrath argues that
    even the most developed Christologies in the New Testament fit within the
    context of first century Jewish monotheism. McGrath pinpoints when the
    parting of ways took place over the issue of God's oneness, and explores
    philosophical ideas such as "creation out of nothing" which caused Jews and
    Christians to develop differing concepts and definitions about God.

  abstract: |-
    In this work, a sequel to my
                  A New Science: The Discovery of Religion in an Age of Reason
                  (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2010), I study some major aspects of the scholarly study of religion in the long nineteenth century—from the Enlightenment to the First World War. More precisely, I seek to understand the new status of Judaism and Islam in the formative period of the new discipline. In order to do that, I focus on the concept of Semitic monotheism, a concept developed by Ernest Renan around the mid-nineteenth century, on the basis of the postulated (and highly problematic) contradistinction between Aryan and Semitic families of peoples, cultures, and religions. This contradistinction grew from the Western discovery of Sanskrit and its relationship with European languages, at the time of the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Together with the rise of scholarly Orientalism, this discovery offered new perspectives on the East, as a consequence of which the Near East was demoted, as it were, from its traditional status as the locus of the biblical revelations. The book essentially studies a central issue in the modern study of religion. Doing so, however, it emphasizes that the new dualistic taxonomy of religions had major consequences and sheds new light on the roots of European attitudes to Jews and Muslims in the twentieth century and up to the present day.

  abstract: >-
    Early Christology must focus not simply on "historical" but also on
    theological ideas found in contemporary Jewish thought and practice. In this
    book, a range of distinguished contributors considers the context and
    formation of early Jewish and Christian devotion to God alone-the emergence
    of "monotheism." The idea of monotheism is critically examined from various
    perspectives, including the history of ideas, Graeco-Roman religions, early
    Jewish mediator figures, scripture exegesis, and the history of its use as a
    theological category.The studies explore different ways of conceiving of
    early Christian monotheism today, asking whether monotheism is a
    conceptually useful category, whether it may be applied cautiously and with
    qualifications, or whether it is to be questioned in favor of different
    approaches to understanding the origins of Jewish and Christian beliefs and
    worship.This is volume 1 in the Early Christianity in Context series and
    volume 263 in the Journal for the Study of the New Testament Supplement
