    The contemporary fields of the study of culture, the humanities and the
    social sciences are unfolding in a dynamic constellation of cultural turns.
    This book provides a comprehensive overview of these theoretically and
    methodologically groundbreaking reorientations. It discusses the value of
    the new focuses and their analytical categories for the work of a wide range
    of disciplines. In addition to chapters on the interpretive, performative,
    reflexive, postcolonial, translational, spatial and iconic turns, it
    discusses emerging directions of research. Drawing on a wealth of
    international research, this book maps central topics and approaches in the
    study of culture and thus provides systematic impetus for changed
    disciplinary and transdisciplinary research in the humanities and beyond -
    e.g., in the fields of sociology, economics and the study of religion. This
    work is the English translation by Adam Blauhut of an influential German
    book that has now been completely revised. It is a stimulating example of a
    cross-cultural translation between different theoretical cultures and also
    the first critical synthesis of cultural turns in the English-speaking
    world.

  abstract: >-
    This chapter considers the computational turn in relation to some of the
    diverse frameworks through which digital artifacts and practices, taken
    separately or explored in various configurations, are being defined,
    categorised, and claimed for various disciplines, sub-disciplines,
    anti-disciplines, or academic fields; for this tradition or that. In this
    process of course not only the artifacts and practices,but also the
    frameworks themselves, are being reconstituted. If the latter are rendered
    computational in various ways, the former are hacked into shape,rendered
    fit, or made amenable and suitable for certain modes of analysis. This kind
    of work might thus redefine conventional takes on computation and its
    (cultural, social, economic, aesthetic, material) significance, replace the
    traditional object of enquiry within a particular field with its
    computationally transformed upgrade, and relocate the field itself so that
    it extends across new terrain – or operates in new dimensions.

  abstract: >-
    A visionary report on the revitalization of the liberal arts tradition in
    the electronically inflected, design-driven, multimedia language of the
    twenty-first century. Digital_Humanities is a compact, game-changing report
    on the state of contemporary knowledge production. Answering the question
    "What is digital humanities?," it provides an in-depth examination of an
    emerging field. This collaboratively authored and visually compelling volume
    explores methodologies and techniques unfamiliar to traditional modes of
    humanistic inquiry--including geospatial analysis, data mining, corpus
    linguistics, visualization, and simulation--to show their relevance for
    contemporary culture. Written by five leading practitioner-theorists whose
    varied backgrounds embody the intellectual and creative diversity of the
    field, Digital_Humanities is a vision statement for the future, an
    invitation to engage, and a critical tool for understanding the shape of new
    scholarship.

    $$Csummary$$VA book at the intersection of data science and media studies,
    presenting concepts and methods for computational analysis of cultural
    data.How can we see a billion images? What analytical methods can we bring
    to bear on the astonishing scale of digital culture--the terabytes of
    photographs shared on social media every day, the hundreds of millions of
    songs created by twenty million musicians on Sound Cloud, the content of
    four billion Pinterest boards? In Cultural Analytics, Lev Manovich presents
    concepts and methods for computational analysis of cultural data, with a
    particular focus on visual media. Drawing on more than a decade of research
    and projects from his own lab, Manovich--the founder of the field of
    cultural analytics--offers a gentle, nontechnical introduction to selected
    key concepts of data science and discusses the ways that our society uses
    data and algorithms.Manovich offers examples of computational cultural
    analysis and discusses the shift from new media to more media; explains how
    to turn cultural processes into computational data; and introduces concepts
    for exploring cultural datasets using data visualization as well as other
    recently developed methods for analyzing image and video datasets. He
    considers both the possibilities and the limitations of computational
    methods, and how using them challenges our existing ideas about culture and
    how to study it. Cultural Analytics is a book of media theory. Arguing that
    before we can theorize digital culture, we need to see it, and that, because
    of its scale, to see it we need computers, Manovich provides scholars with
    practical tools for studying contemporary media.

  abstract: >-
    Web 2.0 provides technologies for online collaboration of users as well as
    the creation, publication and sharing of user-generated contents in an
    interactive way. Twitter, CNET, CiteSeerX, etc. are examples of Web 2.0
    platforms which facilitate users in these activities and are viewed as rich
    sources of information. In the platforms mentioned as examples, users can
    participate in discussions, comment others, provide feedback on various
    issues, publish articles and write blogs, thereby producing a high volume of
    unstructured data which at the same time leads to an information overload.
    To satisfy various types of human information needs arising from the purpose
    and nature of the platforms requires methods for appropriate aggregation and
    automatic analysis of this unstructured data. In this thesis, we propose
    methods which attempt to overcome the problem of information overload and
    help in satisfying user information needs in three scenarios. 


    To this end, first we look at two of the main challenges of sparsity and
    content quality in Twitter and how these challenges can influence standard
    retrieval models. We analyze and identify Twitter content features that
    reflect high quality information. Based on this analysis we introduce the
    concept of "interestingness" as a static quality measure. We empirically
    show that our proposed measure helps in retrieving and filtering high
    quality information in Twitter. Our second contribution relates to the
    content diversification problem in a collaborative social environment, where
    the motive of the end user is to gain a comprehensive overview of the pros
    and cons of a discussion track which results from social collaboration of
    the people. For this purpose, we develop the FREuD approach which aims at
    solving the content diversification problem by combining latent semantic
    analysis with sentiment estimation approaches. Our evaluation results show
    that the FREuD approach provides a representative overview of sub-topics and
    aspects of discussions, characteristic user sentiments under different
    aspects, and reasons expressed by different opponents. Our third
    contribution presents a novel probabilistic Author-Topic-Time model, which
    aims at mining topical trends and user interests from social media. Our
    approach solves this problem by means of Bayesian modeling of relations
    between authors, latent topics and temporal information. We present results
    of application of the model to the scientific publication datasets from
    CiteSeerX showing improved semantically cohesive topic detection and
    capturing shifts in authors" interest in relation to topic evolution.

    As more and more aspects of everyday life are turned into machine-readable
    data, researchers are provided with rich resources for researching society.
    The novel methods and innovative tools to work with this data not only
    require new knowledge and skills, but also raise issues concerning the
    practices of investigation and publication. This book critically reflects on
    the role of data in academia and society and challenges overly optimistic
    expectations considering data practices as means for understanding social
    reality. It introduces its readers to the practices and methods for data
    analysis and visualization and raises questions not only about the politics
    of data tools, but also about the ethics in collecting, sifting through
    data, and presenting data research. AUP S17 Catalogue text 
     
    As machine-readable data comes to play an increasingly important role in
    everyday life, researchers find themselves with rich resources for studying
    society. The novel methods and tools needed to work with such data require
    not only new knowledge and skills, but also a new way of thinking about best
    research practices. This book critically reflects on the role and usefulness
    of big data, challenging overly optimistic expectations about what such
    information can reveal, introducing practices and methods for its analysis
    and visualization, and raising important political and ethical questions
    regarding its collection, handling, and presentation.
