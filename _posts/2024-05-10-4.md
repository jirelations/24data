## Assignment

- [ ] Make a change to the "carrot cake" recipe on our [recipes website](https://24recipes.pages.gwdg.de/) or add a new recipe there. (See instructions below.)

## Tutorial for Git Versioning

### 1. Getting started

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). When it asks for your username and password, press "skip". For "name" and "email address" you can give anything you don't mind showing up publicly (a pseudonym or junk email address is fine).
2. Clone the project/repository <https://gitlab.gwdg.de/24recipes/24recipes.pages.gwdg.de>

### 2. Syncing and editing files

1. In GitHub Desktop, create a new branch.

    </video> 

2. Open the project/repository in Visual Studio Code.
3. Edit one of the files in `_posts_` or create a new one with the name and date, such as `2024-05-06-cookies.md`

If you're feeling confident and would like to try creating a new file, you can do so by making another file in the `_posts_` directory, named the same way, with the date (YYYY-MM-DD) and then a name and the `.md` extension.

4. Commit changes and publish your branch (using the password in [OLAT](https://olat-ce.server.uni-frankfurt.de/olat/auth/RepositoryEntry/20670545926/CourseNode/1713408124938163007) and any username).

###  Setting up an account in Gitlab GWDG

1. Log into <https://academiccloud.de/> using "Federated Login" > "Universit√§t Frankfurt". 
2. After you're logged in, go to <https://id.academiccloud.de/account>. Copy the "username" and "Academic ID" that appears there and send them to me. I'll request access for you. 
3. Once I let you know you have access, sign in at <https://gitlab.gwdg.de/users/sign_in?redirect_to_referer=yes>. 

###  Creating a merge request

1. Go to the project <https://gitlab.gwdg.de/24recipes/24recipes.pages.gwdg.de>. 
2. At the top left, under the title "Recipes," change the branch from `master` to the one you created. 
3. On the top right, click "Compare." (The Source will be set as your branch and the Target should say "master".)
4. Click "Create Merge Request," then scroll to the bottom of the new page and click "Create Merge Request" again. I will be able to see and approve the merge request. Once I do, your changes will appear on the website at <https://24recipes.pages.gwdg.de/>.
